# AP2_Metro_Nyam

The code was made by Oriol Lopez Petit and Thomas Gonzalez Saito.The implementation has changed a little to what the github requested (an example is that nodes are treated as hashable objects in the nodes of a gaph), but the majority follows the guidelines. 

The bot's name is Toni Montana and the user is t.me/NotAQuitterBot, and by starting the module bot.py the bot will be active and converation can be started using the /start command.
