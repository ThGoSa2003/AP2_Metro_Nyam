# AP2_Metro_Nyam

The code was made by Oriol L칩pez Petit and Thomas Gonz치lez Saito. The implementation has changed a little to what the github requested (an example is that nodes are treated as hashable objects in the nodes of a gaph), but the majority follows the guidelines.

This is a bot of telegram that will give a user the path of a restaurant given a search of attributes and his/her
location. To use this bot you need to start the module bot.py with python3 or later and the bot will be active. The conversation can be started using the /start command.

## Getting started

In order to try this bot you need to have python3 and pip installed. If not:

For linux systems write these in the command line

```
sudo apt install pip
sudo apt install python3
```

if you use windows or mac use the installer given in the official website.

Moreover, in order to execute the programs you will need to install some libraries:

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
